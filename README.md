# Feed Forward

Feed Forward is a web-based application designed to reduce food wastage by connecting PG and hostel owners with surplus food to individuals and organizations that can distribute it to those in need. This project aims to tackle hunger and food insecurity in urban areas by providing a platform for sharing leftover food that would otherwise go to waste.
